# Corifeus Matrix

## Issues / Support
This is an open source project. Time is a precious thing, so I have no time to give support and fix issues for someone else. I fix a bug, when I have an error that I need. If you got an issue, error or bug, I hope someone will have time to do it for you, otherwise, you are on you own.

Though, if I know the solution, I will tell you.

If you want to extend, fix bugs and add in new features on your own time, I help you , as ```patrikx3``` is an orgnization. I can add in anyone in no time. Not forking, you become a member, do not even need a pull merge request.
